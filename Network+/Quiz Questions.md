Question 1:
Which type of network device operates at layer 1 of the OSI model and requires connected devices to operate at half-duplex using CSMA/CD?
A hub is a network hardware device for connecting multiple Ethernet devices together and making them act as a single network segment. A hub operates at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model. All devices connected by a hub are in a single collision domain and a single broadcast domain, therefore they must use half-duplex for communication and CSMA/CD.


Question 2:
Which of the following applies to data as it travels from Layer 1 to Layer 7 of the OSI model?
Data encapsulation and de-encapsulation in a computer network is a necessary process. De-encapsulation in networking is performed at the receiver side or destination side as data moves from layer 1 to layer 7 of the OSI model. As information travels up the layers of the OSI layer, information added from the senderâ€™s encapsulation process is removed layer by layer.


Question 3:
According to the OSI model, at which of the following layers is data encapsulated into a frame?
The data layer, or layer 2, is the second layer of the seven-layer OSI model. The data link layer encapsulates data into frames for delivery between nodes on the same network. Data is transmitted at Layers 5, 6, and 7 of the OSI model. At Layer 4, the data is encapsulated into segments. At layer 3, the segments are encapsulated into packets. At layer 2, the packets are encapsulated into frames. At layer 1, the frames are encapsulated into bits.


Question 4:
Which network device operates at layer 2?
A basic switch operates at layer 2 of the OSI model. For the exam, unless they mention a "multilayer switch" or "layer 3 switch", always assume they are referencing a basic layer 2 switch. A router is a layer 3 device. A repeater is a layer 1 device. A firewall will operate layers 3 through 7, depending on the type of firewall.


Question 5:
What layer of the OSI model is responsible for data encryption and character set conversion, such as ASCII to UTF-8?
The presentation layer (layer 6) establishes the way in which information is presented, typically for display or printing. Data encryption and character set conversion (such as ASCII to EBCDIC) are usually associated with this layer. The presentation layer translates information in a way that the application layer understands. This layer also translates information from the application layer to the session layer.
